# JavaTest

JavaTest is a Java project showcasing multiple algorithms and utility functions. This project demonstrates solutions for string manipulations, sorting, date range validation, finding the lowest frequency character, and solving mathematical equations. The project utilizes Insertion Sort combined with Binary Search to optimize sorting, alongside other useful methods.

### Features:

1. **String Manipulations**:
   - Reverse a string without using the built-in `String` methods.
   - Sort a string in ascending order without using the built-in sorting methods.
   
2. **Sorting Algorithms**:
   - Sort an array of integers using Insertion Sort, combined with Binary Search to optimize the sorting process.
   
3. **Date Range Validation**:
   - Check if a given date is within a specific date range.
   
4. **Finding the Character with the Lowest Occurrence:**:
   - Find the character in a given alphanumeric string with the lowest frequency of occurrence.

4. **Mathematical Equation Solver:**:
   - Solve equations based on the input number (x) and a series of string-based equations.

### Usage:

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/JavaTest.git
